Patrick访谈以太坊组织的研究人员--Justin，内容包括：

- 以太坊和比特币的区别
- 以太坊平台孵化的项目数量日益增长
- 共识算法从工作量证明到权益证明的转变，对以太坊的意义



## Key Concepts of BTC


1. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin, but is far more programmable, meaning other applications and currencies can be built on top of it.
2. Its native cryptocurrency is Ether, which today stands as the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. 
3. recently，transaction fees on the Ethereum network have  approached $15 million per day, meaning there's a real and growing demand to use the Ethereum network
1. I think of a blockchain as a coordination platform for people on the Internet, who don't necessarily trust each other or know each other. 
2. The Internet, in its first stage, gives us incredible communication powers with real-time video.Now, we're extending this to the ability to be this trust platform for people who don't trust each other。
3. It's more trust in the code, trust in the mathematics, trust in the technology. And this really opens up all sorts of exciting innovations.
4. 比特币本质是账本，记录每个人有多少比特币。
5. 货币的本质，一个账本，这个账本记录每个人有多少购买力。
6. 关于安全性，最安全的东西是时间，时间有3个属性，过去的不可篡改。第二个属性是，当下，对所有人，是一个共享的体验（shared experience）。第三个属性是，未来是确定的，一定会发生，没有任何人能够阻止。
7. 回到货币上，过去的交易不可篡改，每个人都能信任比特币的状态，不用第三方。绕开审查（Censorship resistance），如果比特币是一个计算器，以太坊就是一个计算机。
8. 矿工让彼此不信任的人达成共识，理应获得BTC作为报酬。


## 以太坊

1. what was the original impetus（动力） in early history here? 
2. Why was Ethereum created?
3. What shortcomings of Bitcoin did it seek to address in the early days?
1. 比特币的编程能力有限，以太坊扩展了变成能力。
2. 说一说以太坊创始人Vitalik的想法？
3. The reason that proof-of-stake is so much cheaper than proof-of-work is that the cost of money, which is basically the opportunity cost of money, is relatively low
4. The rewards that you get as a validator are, number one, issuance but also these tips that don't get burnt.
5. The way that we do ownership really in the crypto world is using public keys. It's basically cryptography that allows you to prove that you're the owner of something. What it means to go buy an NFT is, at the end of the day, to basically change this ledger entry to add your public key as the owner of this hash.
6. We have, right now, 130,000 validators that are securing the proof-of-stake in Ethereum. This is going to grow to half a million or even close to a million validators. Another thing that is important is to understand that the proof-of-stake is best-in-class in terms of security. Just to give you one compelling reason for that is that when we have this scarce resource securing your consensus engine being money placed as collateral, you have the option to destroy it fully. If an attacker is in a position to be able to attack Ethereum, meaning that it has amassed all these economic resources, well, as soon as they make an attack, we can penalize them and remove them from the system so the system is self-healing. Actually, because there's only a finite number of ETH out there, we can actually put an upper bound on the number of times that an attacker can successfully make an attack. It's on the order of 10 times
7. Be intellectually curious, be intellectually honest in the sense that participating in things that you understand and whenever there's something you don't understand, don't be shy to ask questions. There's a lot of information out there. Actually, on that point a lot of information out there, there's also a lot of bad information out there. This is a very organic, decentralized, and chaotic space.
