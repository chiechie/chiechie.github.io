> 基于剃刀原则的几个思维模型，from Sahil Bloom的twitter 


## The Steve Jobs Quality Razor


When building, take pride in carrying the quality all the way through.Would you be proud for your work to be seen from every angle and perspective? If not, keep working.

## The ELI5 Razor

- Complexity and jargon are often used to mask a lack of true understanding.
- If you can’t explain it to a 5-year-old, you don’t really understand it.
- If someone uses a lot of complexity and jargon to explain something to you, they probably don’t understand it.

## Munger’s Rule of Opinions

“I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.” - Charlie Munger

Opinions aren’t free. You have to work to earn the right to have them.

## The Bezos Regret Minimization Framework

The goal is to minimize the number of regrets in life.

When faced with a difficult decision:
(1) Project yourself into the future
(2) Look back on the decision
(3) Ask "Will I regret not doing this?"
(4) Take action

## Buffett’s Rule of Holes

“The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging." - Warren Buffett

When things aren’t working, change course and try something different.

When you find yourself at the bottom of a hole, stop digging and climb out of it.

## PG's  Crazy Idea Razor

If someone proposes a crazy idea, ask:

1. Are they a domain expert?
2. Do I know them to be reasonable?

If yes on (1) and (2), you should take the idea seriously, as it may be an asymmetric bet on the future.

## The Boaster’s Razor

Truly successful people rarely feel the need to boast about their success.

If someone regularly boasts about their income, wealth, or success, it’s fair to assume the reality is a fraction of what they claim.

## The Circle of Competence

Be ruthless in identifying your circle of competence (and its boundaries).

When faced with a big decision, ask yourself whether you are qualified to handle it given your circle. 

If yes, proceed. If no, outsource it to someone who is.

## The Duck Test

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.

You can determine a lot about a person by regularly observing their habitual characteristics.

## Buffett’s Juicy Pitch

“You don't have to swing at everything - you can wait for your pitch." - Warren Buffett

Life doesn’t reward you for the number of swings you take.

Slow down and focus on identifying the juiciest pitch.

When it comes, swing hard and don’t miss it.

## Occam’s Razor

The simplest explanation is often the best one.

Simple assumptions > complex assumptions.

Simple is beautiful.

##  The Buffett Reputation Razor

“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.” - Warren Buffett

Remember that quote and act accordingly.

Your character is your fate.

## Hanlon’s Razor

Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

In assessing someone's actions, we should not assume negative intent if there is a viable alternative explanation, such as different beliefs, incompetence, or ignorance.

汉隆的剃刀

永远不要把可以用愚蠢充分解释的事情归咎于恶意。

在评估某人的行为时，如果有可行的替代解释，例如不同的信念、无能或无知，我们不应假设消极意图。

## nntaleb's The “Look the Part” Razor

If forced to choose between two options of seemingly equal merit, choose the one that doesn’t look the part.

The one who doesn’t look the part has had to overcome much more to achieve its status than the one who fit in perfectly.


如果被迫在看似同等价值的两个选项之间做出选择，请选择一个看起来不合适的选项。

与完美契合的人相比，看起来不合群的人必须克服更多才能获得地位。

## Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword

If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, it is not worth debating.

This will save you from wasting a lot of time on pointless arguments.

牛顿的火焰激光剑

如果一些事情不能通过实验或观察来解决，那就不值得争论了。

这将使您免于在无意义的争论上浪费大量时间。

## Machiavelli’s Razor

Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by self-interest.

In assessing someone's actions, we should not assume negative intent if there is a viable alternative explanation that they are acting on rooted self-interest.

马基雅维利的剃刀

永远不要将可以用自身利益充分解释的事情归咎于恶意。

在评估某人的行为时，如果有一个可行的替代解释表明他们是根据根深蒂固的自身利益行事，我们不应该假设消极意图。

## Hitchens’ Razor

What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.

The burden of proof regarding a claim lies with the one who makes the claim. If unmet, no argument is required to dismiss it.


## Sagan’s Standard

“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

The more crazy and outrageous the claim, the more crazy and outrageous the body of evidence must be in order to prove it.

萨根的标准

“非凡的主张需要非凡的证据。”

声称越疯狂和越离谱，为了证明它，证据主体就必须越疯狂和离谱。



## The Eisenhower Decision Matrix

When faced with a task, ask: “Is this urgent? Is this important?”

An "urgent" task is one that requires immediate attention. An "important" task is one that promotes or furthers your long-term goals.

Place it on a 2x2 matrix and act accordingly.


## The Steve Jobs Settling Razor

“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.” - Steve Jobs

It’s Monday morning. Did you wake up with energy or with dread?

Your answer will tell you if you’re settling.


## The Career Razor

When deciding on a new job, choose the one that will challenge you the most (intellectually, physically, or emotionally).

Challenge and discomfort forces growth.

(P.S. Check out the job board below for challenging new roles!)


## Decisions

• If you can’t decide, the answer is no.

• If two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the short term (pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality).

• Choose the path that leaves you more equanimous in the long term."
