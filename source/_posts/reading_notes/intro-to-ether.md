## 前面

Patrick访谈以太坊组织的研究人员--Justin，内容包括：

1. Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin, but is far more programmable, meaning other applications and currencies can be built on top of it.
2. Its native cryptocurrency is Ether, which today stands as the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. 
3. recently，transaction fees on the Ethereum network have  approached $15 million per day, meaning there's a real and growing demand to use the Ethereum network



## Key Concepts

1. I think of a blockchain as a coordination platform for people on the Internet, who don't necessarily trust each other or know each other. 
2. The Internet, in its first stage, gives us incredible communication powers with real-time video.Now, we're extending this to the ability to be this trust platform for people who don't trust each other。
3. It's more trust in the code, trust in the mathematics, trust in the technology. And this really opens up all sorts of exciting innovations.
4. 比特币本质是账本，记录每个人有多少比特币。
5. 货币的根本作用就是，一个账本，这个账本记录每个人有多少购买力。
